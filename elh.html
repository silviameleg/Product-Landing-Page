                <span>You are a champion</span> is a free programme and was
                created to help children and teenagers in financial difficulty.
                It has been proved that the best way to fight against poverty is
                to destroy the root of it.
                As great as it is to help someone in need, it's even greater to
                teach that person to provide for themselves and never again be
                in need.
                This is what the programme is all about. Our goal is to show
                these little hearts the great potential they have and to guide
                them towards a much better future.
                The practical side of things is simple: you can sign up for the
                programme <a href=”#”>here<a> or perhaps you know someone that
                        could benefit from this programme, you can propose them
                        filling <a href="#">this form</a>. To qualify, a
                        candidate must be
                        under de age of 18.
                        The second step will be us getting in touch with you.
                        And after the registration process is over, you are on
                        for the most exciting experience!
                        Our volunteer mentors will teach you how to create
                        amazing games, mobile application and so much more!
                        And the best part is, we have interactive learning
                        classes for any age group, so every little heart is
                        welcomed.
                        Our partners will supply you with a free meal every day
                        and we promise you will have fun!
                        For the students that reach the age of hiring, there are
                        employment opportunities with our partners and we will
                        do our best to help you get the job of your dreams and
                        destroy poverty in your life and your family’s for good.
                        We look forward to meet you and change the world
                        together!
